## Related Projects

This project was inspired by other clever uses of markdown where files are
used for something more powerful than just documentation.
e.g. the ![`maid`](https://github.com/egoist/maid) task runner, and of course
![`mdx`](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx)

Icons provided by [devicon](https://github.com/devicons/devicon).
Code for the snippet table summary was heavily influenced by remark-toc
